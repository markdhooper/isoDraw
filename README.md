# isoDraw
An primitive drawing application that allows for fast conversion from cartesian to isometric coordinates.

I made this to facilitate the illusttration of some isometric buildings that I'm making for a tabletop RPG campaign I plan on running. (I've got some examples of the final illustrations posted here as well.)

It is very much a work in progress. There are some features that I want to implement like a 3-view to isometric. which would help people struggling with visualizing 3d objects in engineering drawing/drafting courses. Also I need to add circles/elipses as well as a UI and erase functionality.
